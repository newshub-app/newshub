    "description": "Have you ever found an HTTP desync vulnerability that seemed impossible to exploit due to its complicated constraints? In this blogpost we will explore a new exploitation technique that can be used to completely compromise a web application using TRACE - an ancient HTTP method that's more widely supported than you might think.",

    "description": "In the world of software development, we often take for granted the security and reliability of the tools and platforms we rely on daily. We assume that the packages we download and the registries we use are safe and trustworthy. However, at Lupin & Holmes we've recently discovered a Cache Poisoning Attack on the npm registry, one of the largest package registry for JavaScript, potentially exposing the fragility of our Software Supply Chains and the potential for widespread disruption.",

    "description": "Over the past few years we’ve observed a fundamental shift in the threat model for highly targeted organizations.\r\n\r\nToday, if an attacker can’t manage to steal user credentials for highly targeted organizations, they will pivot to instead stealing a user’s proof of authentication.\r\n\r\nAttackers will use malware to steal session tokens from a user’s browser after they sign in. They may similarly use transparent proxies to steal session tokens from a user’s browser after they sign in. And as Okta’s recent experience shows, if bearer tokens of any kind are stored unprotected, attackers will sniff them out. Stolen session tokens can often be replayed in a browser of the attacker’s choosing for the remaining duration of the user session.",
